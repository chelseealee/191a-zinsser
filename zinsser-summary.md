# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Chelsea Schneider

One of Zinsser's main points in "On Writing Well" was to simplify sentences. Writers should eliminate words that are not vital to the sentence. Zinsser states removing excess verbiage leads to simplicity and sentences that are easy to understand.
